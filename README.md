# Mondrian-Classical-Machine-Learning

This is a project of the Machine Learning course in SCM, City University of Hong Kong.
In this project, I try to use classical machine learning methods to analyze or recreate Piet Mondrian's composition paintings.
The dataset used for this project is from the research article of Andrzejewski et al (2010).
All the python code is written by myself.
